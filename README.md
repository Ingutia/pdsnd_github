### Project Title
Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description
In this project, we will use Python to explore bike share system data
for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City,
and Washington. We will write code to import the data and compute
descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions. Additionally,
we will create a script that takes raw input to provide an interactive
terminal experience for presenting these statistics.

#### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in
number and popularity in cities worldwide. These systems allow users
to rent bicycles for short-term use at a fee. Users can pick up a bike
at one location (point A) and return it at another (point B) or at the
same location. Each bike can serve multiple users per day.
